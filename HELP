SIIT -- Simple I3 Installation Tool (Version 1)

 SIIT is a tool to automate the installation of the i3 window manager for
Debian and Ubuntu based systems.

Commands:
 
    siit = Complete custom i3wm installation.

    Running siit with no options will install i3wm along with a custom
selection of packages that aim to make the system ready to use with minimal
, if any configuration.

    siit --minimal = Install just i3 and X.

    Using the minimal option just installs i3 and the X server. The bare essentials
to make i3 work. The user can then further configure the system to their needs.

    siit --help = Shows this help page.

    siit --list = Displays a list of all the software included in the full install.
